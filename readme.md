## Quick User Properties Export Tool (QUPET)

_The Quick User Properties Export Tool (QUPET) allows you to easily export user properties from Active Directory or mailbox data in Office 365 to a CSV. You can also directly pipe the discovered AD users towards Office 365 with just 1 click!_

For the best experience you will need:
- Windows PowerShell version 3 or higher
- Active Directory PowerShell Module
- Windows Azure Active Directory Module for PowerShell
- Sufficient access in Office 365 (Exchange Online)
- Domain joined workstation

The minimal requirements are:
- Windows PowerShell version 3 or higher
- Domain joined workstation

Use the applicable search fields to find users. You can use *.* in the UPN field to find all. Partial strings are allowed.
To find properties for existing users, you can also import a CSV file (using _File - Open CSV_). 

The CSV file should use the semicolon (;) as delimiter and contain at least the userprincipalname.

CSV Example:

DisplayName;UserPrincipalName;Property;Property;etc<br>
Doe,John;john.doe@domain.com;1;2;etc<br>
Doe,Jane;jane.doe@domain.com;4;5;etc<br>

**If you only want the tool and don't care about what the script does, you will only need:**
- QUPET.exe

On first run, edit your settings (File -> Settings)
